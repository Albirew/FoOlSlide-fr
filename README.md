**[NO LONGER MAINTAINED]**: We have decided to no longer maintaining or providing support for this software. This is mainly due to years of inactivity from our team. There is an _unofficial_ fork located at https://github.com/chocolatkey/FoOlSlide2 which is being maintained by someone else in the community. Please use that instead for any future installations.
